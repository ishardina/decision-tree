We will be implementing a simple decision tree model to classify iris plants into three species using the lengths and widths of their petals and sepals, a classic data set in the machine learning community.

Decision Trees

Decision tree models are the simplest form of tree-based models, and are arguably the simplest form of supervised multivariate classification models. A series of logical tests (generally in the form of boolean comparisons) are applied to the sample entries and their resulting subsets in turn to arrive at a final decision. It is very easy to visualize the decision process in a simple flowchart to trace the rational of every assignment made by a decision tree model, making it among the most interpretable of models.
